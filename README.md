Requirements

    *ffmpeg should be installed on your system, you can install it by following the instructions for your operating system.

**Usage**

    *Run the script and pass the path to the m3u file as an argument.
    *The script will output the m3u8 file in the same directory as the m3u file, with the same name but with the .m3u8 extension.

**Example**

"m3u_to_m3u8('path/to/file.m3u')"

The above command will convert the file.m3u to file.m3u8 in the same directory.
